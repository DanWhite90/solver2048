Gameplay flow:

1) Use previous grid state (start from empty)
2) Check termination conditions
3) Add random tile with animation (lock input)
----------
4) Player move - process game logic
5) Animate tiles to reach new destination (lock input)
6) Render new values of tiles at the end of the animation (upgrade redux store to trigger rerender)
7) GOTO 1)
